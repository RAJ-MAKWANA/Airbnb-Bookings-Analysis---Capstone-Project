# Airbnb Bookings Analysis â€“ Capstone Project

## Overview
This project involves comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings data, aiming to uncover actionable insights for understanding host behaviors, listing performance, geographical trends, and pricing strategies. The analysis is done using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains approximately 48,895 observations and 16 features:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each listing.
- **name**: Listing title.
- **host_id**: Unique identifier for each host.
- **host_name**: Name of the host.
- **neighbourhood_group**: Broad geographical grouping.
- **neighbourhood**: Specific neighbourhood of the listing.
- **latitude**: Latitude coordinate.
- **longitude**: Longitude coordinate.
- **room_type**: Type of room offered.
- **price**: Price per night.
- **minimum_nights**: Minimum nights required per booking.
- **number_of_reviews**: Total reviews received.
- **last_review**: Date of the last review.
- **reviews_per_month**: Monthly review count.
- **calculated_host_listings_count**: Number of listings per host.
- **availability_365**: Availability of the listing per year.

## Objectives
- Identify patterns in host behaviors and listing performance.
- Examine pricing variations across different neighborhoods and room types.
- Discover busiest hosts and analyze factors influencing host activity.
- Investigate differences in traffic and popularity among various areas.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions and relationships using various plots.
   - Identifying correlations among variables.

3. **Key Insights and Findings**
   - Highlighting busiest neighborhoods and hosts.
   - Price analysis based on location and room types.
   - Impact of reviews and availability on listing popularity.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
